# Jammy templates

Only one .tf file can be in the pwd during the terraform by default, so delete whatever isn't getting used :)

There are two .tf files, the basic minimal one `ubuntu2022jammy.tf` and another more detailed one `ubuntu2022jammy_with_net.tf` with post provision execution and network rules.
